# DoubleDAO

[DoubleDAO](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/384243) is a DAO tooling and governance protocol meant to streamline DAO deployment. With a configurable and modular structure, DAO leaders and community members simply choose the on-chain tooling they require and DoubleDAO provides code-free integration. This model is similar to a SaaS structure, and functionality can be added as needed. Furthermore, the $DD token helps ensure incentives are aligned across the mothership DAO (DoubleDAO platform) and the member DAOs that rely on its services.

DoubleDAO offers several key features:

- Secure storage of a DAO's funds
- Integrated voting mechanism
- Configurable base framework with methods for extension
- Fair distribution of dividends and prizes to token holders
- An easy-to-use frontend for DAO bootstrapping

## Progress Report

### October 2022

October was a busy month for the Clarity/DoubleDAO project, especially on the Business Development side. We met with major Cardano projects at RareBloom, cNFTcon, and the Web 3 Expo. We participated in panel discussions and the like, networking constantly, and The Clarity Twitter handle (@clarity_dao) showcases these efforts nicely. A platform aimed at promoting and facilitating DAO adoption, this type of work is vital to the recognition of our project and, ultimately, making the Cardano ecosystem more decentralized.

Perhaps more importantly, Clarity also kicked off our DAO pitch competition and saw greater-than-expected interest and proposal submissions -- 22 DAOs building on Cardano are aiming to qualify for the competition. Although this initiative was not funded in Fund9, we decided to push forward regardless because it stands to underpin an ecosystem of robust DAOs. Submissions closed Oct 18th, and we are anticipating the results.

On the development side, upbeat progress continued. We updated CTL to v2, ushering in Babbage support while updating our offchain code. Developers added support for querying a user's wallets for Governance tokens - an important feature - and worked to simplify the deployment of reference scripts.

Simultaneously, we worked through several front-end features to improve the user experience. Users can now manage how their favorite DAOs are displayed, more easily explore DAOs, and interact with and create governance proposals. A significant step, we also finalized the flow of DAO creations. This straightforward process allows users to easily create new DAOs by filling out a multi-step online form. 

### September 2022

The Clarity team continued its weekly Town Hall breakout rooms in support of its Fund9 proposals and the project overall. Several collaborations and partnerships are underway, with some announced over the last month (e.g., Genius Yield, see [@clarity_dao](https://twitter.com/clarity_dao) on Twitter for details).

On the development side, work on the governance protocol (e.g., proposal advancement) continued. Engineers initially faced complications minimizing UTXO script size as well as incorporating government authority tokens (GATs, see [Liqwid-labs/Agora](https://github.com/Liqwid-Labs/agora)) throughout the relevant modules and processes. Devs will likely rely on reference scripts to sidestep the limitations and issues encountered. The team began integrating the CTL, an MLabs [Fund8-funded proposal](https://bit.ly/3qO07S8). Currently, CTL v2 is supported (including Babbage features).

Finally, high-level progress was also made. UX/UI was improved, and the team accomplished more thorough MVP planning and scoping. Further detail on development updates can be found in the [Clarity Community Discord](http://bit.ly/38DT1cU).

### August 2022

Recently, the Clarity Discord has experienced robust membership growth as
the governance NFT is in its early stages of release, and the first community vote has opened.
Work has begun on a DAO incubator program that is currently up for [Catalyst
funding](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/414261). Moreover, work ramped up on
integrating with a key early partner project. Initial PRs concerning voting integration were
submitted for review and merged. A DAO Alliance is currently underway, and promos and outreach were
continued. Finally, a partner DAO readied the release of its staking mechanism.

### July 2022

During the Fund7 round, MLabs was approached by Clear Contracts about
consolidating their [similar proposal](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/382311) with ours.
Their project was already in development, so MLabs considered this a synergistic situation and
agreed. Fortunately, both proposals were funded providing a strong foundation early on, and the 
MLabs - Clear Contracts partnership was made official early in 2022. Since, the Clear Contracts 
team has spearheaded outreach, frontend development, and business development while MLabs has 
guided smart contract development and also assisted with business development. 

Early in the project, a [whitepaper](https://docsend.com/view/897694qig7qux37e) was drafted, frontend demos helped
clarify functionality, and initial partnerships were formed. Moreover, team members began
exploring the [Agora governance model](https://github.com/Liqwid-Labs/agora) to understand
whether it could be integrated. Eventually, the team decided to fork the Agora
module and incorporate it, and technical specifications were drafted.

Partnerships with [Genius X](https://www.genius-x.co/) and [Liqwid Labs](https://www.liqwid.finance/) have been established.
An advisory board is also being established:
* Dwayne Cameron (CEO Liqwid Labs)
* Shannon Wu (Early member of MakerDAO, Bloom Protocol)
* Mateen Motavaf (CEO SundaeSwap)
* Luke deWilde (Corporate Development, Golden State Warriors)
