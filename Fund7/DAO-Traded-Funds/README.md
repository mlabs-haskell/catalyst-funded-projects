# DAO-Traded-Funds

[DAO-Traded-Funds (DTF)](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/381055) is a DeFi protocol supporting "crypto ETFs and index funds" for easy investing. A constituent fund, an iDTF, is a vehicle managed in a prescribed manner through arbitrage trading by community members (see [rebalance.png](https://github.com/somthn0somthn/catalyst-funded-projects/blob/main/Fund7/DAO-Traded-Funds/rebalance.png)). Investing is passive from a user's perspective, and portfolios are curated by community members to ensure quality iDTFs. Essentially, DTF addresses the same use case as the [Token Sets protocol](https://www.tokensets.com/) on Ethereum, and our [whitepaper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mz5AWiJd1oTPM_3_bF1uN-qNIyUSWN9u/view?usp=sharing) provides more detailed information.

## Current Status

Merged with [Metera](https://metera.io/), a DeFi protocol on Cardano that creates sustainable portfolios.

Rebranding underway.

Early prototype stage.

## Progress Report

(August 2022)
The Metera team will likely rebrand DTF. MLabs formerly considered rebranding, so this is not particularly surprising. Also, tentative branded assets have been developed. Recently, Metera has also been promoting closely with [Cardano 4 Climate (C4C)](https://cardano4climate.com/) as their motivations are closely aligned.

Metera's testnet application is nearing completion and will likely launch in the near term. DTF's architecture is markedly similar, so it will also likely be launched shortly afterward although this has not been entirely decided.

(July 2022)
Originally, we believed DTF would be straightforward to implement from a technical standpoint. This assumption was centered on the simple, vault-like smart contract that comprises the main structure of iDTFs. Indeed, later work with our client Metera (formerly Enigma) verified that such a design was not unduly challenging to implement.

However, upon initiating the DTF project we were confronted with the need for a clear legal structure. We engaged a well-respected international legal firm to guide our structuring of DTF. This team provided a framework that, although complicated, was feasible to execute. Yet, their suggested structuring, from our point of view, involved notable compromises to our vision.

Around that time, MLabs was presented with the opportunity to merge DTF with our client Metera. Essentially, Metera was building the same platform but with a focus on impact projects. Metera's smart contract architecture has largely been developed, so combining efforts was a straightforward call. Following the merger, the MLabs team will continue to offer and support the technical development of the project, while the Metera team will handle marketing and business development.

Currently, the Metera-DTF project is in the early prototype stage. This prototype realizes the functionality described in an early technical specification document.
