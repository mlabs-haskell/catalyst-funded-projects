# DAO-Traded-Funds

[DAO-Traded-Funds (DTF)](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/381055) is a DeFi protocol supporting "crypto ETFs and index funds" for easy investing. A constituent fund, an iDTF, is a vehicle managed in a prescribed manner through arbitrage trading by community members (see [rebalance.png](https://github.com/somthn0somthn/catalyst-funded-projects/blob/main/Fund7/DAO-Traded-Funds/rebalance.png)). Investing is passive from the user's perspective, and portfolios are curated by community members to ensure quality iDTFs. Essentially, DTF addresses the same use case as the [Token Sets protocol](https://www.tokensets.com/) on Ethereum, and our [whitepaper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mz5AWiJd1oTPM_3_bF1uN-qNIyUSWN9u/view?usp=sharing) provides more detailed information.

## Progress Report

### November 2022

Over the last month, MLabs completed the work outlined in our DAO Traded Funds proposal. We submitted our close-out report including a live testnet demo. We will link it below once it has been published throughout IOG channels and the grant is officially closed.

Finally, we will continue to work alongside the Metera team to bring the ESG index funds project to mainnet.

### October 2022

Our efforts focused on Business Development needs throughout October. MLabs and Metera team members met at RareBloom, and both used the opportunity effectively for networking.

Unfortunately, the Metera/DAO-Traded-Funds effort did not receive funding in Catalyst Fund9. This is disappointing because further technical development is largely paused until funding is resolved.

That said, the technical deliverables outlined in the DAO-Traded-Funds Fund7 grant have been delivered far ahead of schedule. This is largely due to MLabs ability to frontload expenses and the commitment and drive of the Metera team. As such, over the coming weeks we intend to submit our closeout report while continuing to source funding to further our project. 

### September 2022

On a high level, the Metera Business Development team focused on promoting their Fund9 proposal. Efforts included Twitter campaigns/Spaces and other collaborative meetings.

We previously shared our v0.1 video demo and POC. Work began on a local testnet deployment using Plutip with the eventual aim of deploying to the public testnet. This is to demonstrate to users/voters that the on-chain portion of the project is functioning. Finally, v0.2 was scoped and a development roadmap was established between MLabs and the Metera Business development team.

### August 2022

The Metera team will likely rebrand DTF. MLabs formerly considered rebranding, so this is hardly surprising. Also, tentative brand assets have been created. Recently, Metera has also been cross-promoting closely with [Cardano 4 Climate (C4C)](https://cardano4climate.com/) as their motivations are closely aligned.

Metera's testnet application is nearing completion, and a v0.2 will be underway once a development plan is established between Metera and MLabs. DTF's architecture is markedly similar to Metera's, so it will likely be incorporated effortlessly. However, Fund7 funds have been allocated to the Metera prototype as it is entirely the same architecture as DTF. That said, through our work with Metera the majority of our proposal milestones have already been achieved.

### **July 2022**

Originally, we believed DTF would be straightforward to implement from a technical standpoint. This assumption was centered on the simple, vault-like smart contract that comprises the main structure of the platform. Indeed, later work with our client Metera (formerly Enigma) verified that our design was not unduly challenging.

However, upon initiating the DTF project we were confronted with the need for a clear legal structure. We engaged a well-respected international legal firm to guide our structuring of DTF. This team provided a framework that, although complicated, was feasible to execute. Yet, their suggested structuring, from our point of view, involved notable compromises to our vision.

Around that time, MLabs was presented with the opportunity to merge DTF with our client Metera. Essentially, Metera was building the same platform but with a focus on impact projects. Metera's smart contract architecture had progressed, so combining efforts was a straightforward call. Following the merger, the MLabs team will continue to offer and support the technical development of the project, while the Metera team will handle marketing and business development.

Currently, the Metera-DTF project is in the early prototype stage. This prototype realizes the functionality described in an early technical specification document and can be easily ported to the DTF protocol.
