# DAO-Traded-Funds

[DAO-Traded-Funds (DTF)](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/381055) is a DeFi protocol supporting "crypto ETFs and index funds" for easy investing. A constituent fund, an iDTF, is a vehicle managed in a prescribed manner through arbitrage trading by community members (see rebalance.png). Investing is passive from the user's perspective, and portfolios are curated by community members to ensure quality iDTFs. Essentially, DTF addresses the same use case as the [Token Sets protocol](https://www.tokensets.com/) on Ethereum, and our whitepaper provides more detailed information.
