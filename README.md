## About this Repo
This repo is a one-stop information hub for MLabs' projects funded through Project Catalyst. Here you will find project overviews and high-level explanations of their motivation and use case. We've included a progress report for each outlining how they are proceeding relative to the goals outlined in their proposals. Some projects feature a demo video for further context.

Finally, overviews contain a link to the original GitHub repo. There available documentation, build instructions, code, etc. can be found.


## Who Are We?
[MLabs](https://mlabs.city) is a Haskell, Rust, Blockchain, and AI consultancy.

With expertise in Haskell and formal methods, MLabs has quickly become a premier development firm in the Cardano ecosystem. We are an IOG Plutus Partner and regularly work with IOG to develop the Cardano blockchain and infrastructure. Our team is composed of talented developers who have helped build community projects such as:

- [Liqwid](https://www.liqwid.finance/) - An open source, algorithmic and non-custodial interest rate protocol built for lenders, borrowers, and developers.
- [SundaeSwap](https://sundaeswap.finance/) - A decentralized trading protocol on Cardano.
- [Indigo](https://indigoprotocol.io/) - An algorithmic, autonomous synthetics protocol for on-chain price exposure to real-world assets.
- [dcSpark](https://www.dcspark.io/) - A product-based blockchain company that builds products and solutions for crypto projects.
- [Seabug](https://seabug.io/) - An NFT marketplace on Cardano offering robust ownership protections and royalty guarantees.
- Many others

Through our work with early-stage projects, we are one of the largest firms of Haskell/Plutus developers in the community. 

Moreover, we also have a talented Rust team that extends our presence cross-chain. In particular, we have done extensive work in the Polkadot and Solana ecosystems.

## What is Project Catalyst?
Project Catalyst is the decentralized funding mechanism of the Cardano blockchain meant to make ecosystem development self-sustaining. Described by IOG as a "turbo-charged innovation engine," it is essentially a treasury that holds regular funding rounds. Engaged community members submit project proposals outlining a tool, platform, initiative, etc. they would like to realize. Proposals enter a vetting and feedback process before submitting to a community vote. Individuals investing in Cardano (e.g., wallets holding a threshold amount of $ADA) then vote on the most promising proposals, and winners receive funding.

More detailed information on Project Catalyst can be found on the [community site](https://projectcatalyst.org/). [Project Catalyst Town Hall meetings](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJEtduyupzMvHNUczCQwfFJGcXzmw2lDwkIf) are held weekly via Zoom and posted afterward on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GMkGz333I0&list=PLnPTB0CuBOByRhpTUdALq4J89m_h7QqLk). They are a great way for newcomers to get involved. Finally, the current round can be followed via the [Cardano IdeaScale page](https://cardano.ideascale.com/).
