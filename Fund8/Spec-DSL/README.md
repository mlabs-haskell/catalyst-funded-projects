## Proposal Roadmap

3 Months: 
- Finish the initial exploratory phase of development and realize a functional specification language usable by advanced users.


3 Months: 
- Checking against production EUTXO scripts and expanding the number of use cases covered by our DSL. We expect to have backtested many working dApps throughout development and have several early-stage dApps designing with and incorporating our product throughout their development process.

12 Months: 
- A fully functional, audited, and flexible DSL suitable for specifying any project type. At the 12-month mark, we anticipate the majority of our attention will be focused on exploring "edge-cases" and filling out the scope of design types supported by our DSL.
