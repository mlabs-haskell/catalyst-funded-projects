Project ID: [900152](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bfnWFa94Y7Zj0G7dtpo9W1nAYGovJbswipxiHT4UE3g/edit#gid=917336114)

## Proposal Roadmap

Roadmap revisited and will be posted here following approval.

## Current Status

Projected renamed "Lambda Buffers." Statement of Milestones (SoM) submitted and awaiting approval.

## Progress Report

### October 2022

Fund9 vote results were announced in late September and our Cardano DApp Schemas proposal was successfully supported by Catalyst voters. We renamed the project to "Lambda Buffers" finding it a more representative name of the project. Because the Lambda Buffers proposal was awarded over $75,000, we must submit and receive approval for a SoM. We submitted our SoM and are currently awaiting confirmation from the Challenge and IOG teams.
