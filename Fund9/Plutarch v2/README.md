# Plutarch v2

Cardano features powerful smart contracts. However, the limits of smart contracts are very tight. Transactions must at most be 16 KiB, which limits the size of scripts heavily such that the computational work possible is also strictly limited. These constraints are here for a good reason, and raising them isnâ€™t a viable long-term solution. Unfortunately, however, Plutus Tx (the tool to compile Haskell to Plutus) struggles to help developers meet these constraints.

Plutarch is a typed eDSL in Haskell for writing efficient Plutus Core validators. The v1.0 introduced several optimizations into the development process by offering developers fine-grained control of the Plutus Core they generate. In fact, a ~75% decrease in CPU, memory, and script size is commonly achievable without giving up valuable type information.

Essentially, Plutarch allows Plutus developers to leverage the beneficial features of Haskell without losing the ability to compile. Plutarch achieves this sleight-of-hand by wrapping data structures in a computational context that mimics mutable state. This allows for type-level operations to occur without manipulating UPLC. Our v2 proposal looks to expand the feature set of the Plutarch project, increase the number of compilation backends, and all-around make the tool more ergonomic and easy to use.

## Current Status

Bootstrapping. Awaiting initial payment.

## Progress Report

### November 2022

Plutarch v2.0 was ramped-up since receiving funding early this month. However, prior to that a final release of Plutarch v1 was merged. This release reflected recent changes to Plutus and fixed several code-quality issues as well as improving ergonomics. Also:
* updating the nix build centered upon our mlabs-tooling.nix flake
* benchmarking improvemetns
* minor tweaks to basic Plutarch data types

On the v2.0 front, work began on expanding Plutarch backend support. Compiling to Nix was an easy first step owing to the decent REPL. A bit more work here will lead to the first major updates before moving on to supporting other backends. 

### October 2022

Fund9 vote results were announced in late September and our Plutarch v2 proposal was successfully supported by Catalyst voters. We have established a team to work on the project and are currently awaiting the first batch of Fund9 payments before beginning work.
