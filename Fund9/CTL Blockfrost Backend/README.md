# CTL Blockfrost Backend

The [Cardano-Transaction-Library (CTL)](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/cardano-transaction-lib) is a toolkit for developers to build transactions for the Cardano Blockchain. Reaching version 1.0 in June 2022 and already seeing on-chain adoption on several large-scale industrial dApps, the CTL is currently using Ogmios to fill this gap. Ogmios is a self-hosted solution, and some features available on Blockfrost are not available from Ogmios, necessitating additional infrastructure. Furthermore, upcoming changes may result in Ogmios being replaced.

A clear alternative approach to making CTL more versatile and useful is to allow Blockfrost as an alternative backend service. Instead of running their own servers, users provide a Blockfrost API key and any other required configuration. However, the maintenance of their server may be greatly reduced or eliminated. Due to the relative ease of use, it's expected that many developers will use the Blockfrost service as a default during development and production. This proposal seeks to accomplish this integration.
