# Embedano

Cardano has emerged as a secure, decentralized, and scalable root-of-trust for decentralized applications of all shapes and sizes. Therefore, it's hardly surprising  that thereâ€™s a lot of demand to run Cardano everywhere. For example, projects like Adosia and Veritree already aggregate data to be published onchain by using embedded/IoT systems. Use cases such as these are subject to resource constraints like network bandwidth, and there are sure to be even more projects as the community continues to develop. Embedano addresses some challenges to using blockchain tech in these resource-constrained settings.

Specifically, Embedano looks to develop an SDK for embedded devices that cover a range of usecases. Similar initiatives -- e.g., Trezor and Ledger -- leave something to be desired in their approached to open source security. Notably,  closed-source code or firmware written in C and Python, neither of which are ideal for hardware wallets.

Embedano looks to deliver Cardano-specific software useful in hardware wallets and products beyond that scope. We expect a majority of this task will involve streaming transactions so constrained embedded devices can offer secure signing capabilities. In turn, embedded devices will be able to sign UTxOs for several applications including sign-in verification (think sites with Google-like single sign-ons except with the Cardadno blockchain), identity verification via Atala Prism, and more.

## Current Status

Statement of Milestones (SoM) submitted and awaiting approval.

## Progress Report

### October 2022

Fund9 vote results were announced in late September and our Embedano proposal was successfully supported by Catalyst voters. Because the Embedano proposal received over $75,000, we must submit and receive approval for an SoM. We submitted our SoM and are currently awaiting confirmation from the Challenge and IOG teams.
