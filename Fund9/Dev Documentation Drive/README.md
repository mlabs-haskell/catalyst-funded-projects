# Dev Documentation Drive

When building a dApp on the Cardano Network, there are several major hurdles to overcome, which are solved through strong documentation in other ecosystems. Very early questions such as 'What tools and libraries should I use to build a production-ready app?' are often tough to answer. This compounds knowledge among experienced developers and prevents new developers from learning the lessons of previous projects.

Our Dev Documentation Drive looks to address this issue. We seek to publish high-quality documentation to ease the learning curve and, overall, reduce development costs and the time needed to bootstrap products. [Dev Documentation Drive](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/420778) will incorporate tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, and reference material towards this end. They will be easily searchable/discoverable, written clearly, readable, reliable, and accurate.

## Current Status

## Progress Report

### November 2022

MLabs began work on the Developer documentation drive this month. This involved a fair amount of management and preparatory groundwork. More specifically, we assigned an initial developer/technical writer and began surveying clients and community members -- as well as internally -- about topics and tools they feel are under documented. 

We also deliberated about how best to host the material and implemented a test blog page in case we decided to host the content on our newly redesigned website. This is an appealing choice in light of recommendations from an SEO specialist we consulted. That said, we hope to begin publishing content soon.

### October 2022

Fund9 vote results were announced in late September and our Dev Documentation Drive proposal was successfully supported by Catalyst voters. We have established a team to work on the project and are currently awaiting the first batch of Fund9 payments before beginning work.
