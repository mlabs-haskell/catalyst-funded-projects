# Dev Documentation Drive

When building a dApp on the Cardano Network, there are several major hurdles to overcome, which are solved through strong documentation in other ecosystems. Very early questions such as 'What tools and libraries should I use to build a production-ready app?' are often tough to answer. This compounds knowledge among experienced developers and prevents new developers from learning the lessons of previous projects.

Our Dev Documentation Drive looks to address this issue. We seek to publish high-quality documentation to ease the learning curve and, overall, reduce development costs and the time needed to bootstrap products. Dev Documentation Drive will incorporate tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, and reference material towards this end. They will be easily searchable/discoverable, written clearly, readable, reliable, and accurate.
