## Proposal Roadmap

Revisited and submitted. We will update this section following approval.

## Current Status

Projected renamed "Seath." Stament of Milestones (SoM) submitted and awaiting approval.

## Progress Report

### October 2022

Fund9 vote results were announced in late September and our Cardano Throughput Solution proposal was successfully supported by Catalyst voters. We renamed the project to "Seath" -- it's snappier sounding, after all -- and organized our Statement of Milestones (SoM). We are currently awaiting confirmation of our SoM by the Challenge and IOG teams.
