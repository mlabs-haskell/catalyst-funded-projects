Project ID: [900152](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bfnWFa94Y7Zj0G7dtpo9W1nAYGovJbswipxiHT4UE3g/edit#gid=917336114)

## Proposal Roadmap

Roadmap revisited and our Statement of Milestones submitted. We will update this section following approval by our Challenge team and IOG.

## Current Status

Projected renamed "Seath." Stament of Milestones (SoM) submitted and awaiting approval.

## Progress Report

### October 2022

Fund9 vote results were announced in late September and our Cardano Throughput Solution proposal was successfully supported by Catalyst voters. We renamed the project to "Seath" -- it's snappier sounding, after all. Because the Seath proposal was awarded over $75,000, we must submit and receive approval of a Statement of Milestones (SoM). We submitted our SoM and are currently awaiting confirmation by the Challenge and IOG teams.
