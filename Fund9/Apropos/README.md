# Apropos

Property tests help ensure mission-critical dApps don’t contain vulnerabilities. They accomplish this by verifying formal properties are upheld throughout code blocks. This is opposed to unit tests which simply assure atomic pieces of code return the correct, anticipated value.  For Haskell, QuickCheck is a groundbreaking and affective tool for developing property tests.

However, writing tests to check every contract permutation and edge-case state is exhausting, if not wholly impossible. Apropos is a metaprogramming toolkit for generating QuickCheck-style property tests from a logical model. This is a particularly powerful approach because the logical model in question can be complex representing thousands of solutions, each of which can become a property test. 

Overall, this makes thorough testing of code simpler – a lot of the heavy lifting is automated – while ensuring edge cases are not overlooked. Our Fund9 Apropos proposal seeks to build out the Apropos project, already underway, to effectively and effortlessly provide more extensive testing and security assurances for Cardano DApps.

## Current Status

Bootstrapping. Awaiting initial payment.

## Progress Report

### October 2022

Fund9 vote results were announced in late September and our Apropos proposal was successfully supported by Catalyst voters. We have established a team to work on the project and are currently awaiting the first batch of Fund9 payments before beginning work.
